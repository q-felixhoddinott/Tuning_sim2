# Progress Tracker

## Current Status Summary
Fresh restart of the tuning_sim project with focus on cleaner, less repetitive code. The original project has been used as reference for core functionality, but this restart will rebuild capabilities incrementally with simplified implementations. Currently setting up foundation with core scorecard simulation functionality.

## Recent Accomplishments
- Successfully created new tuning_sim2 project structure using UV and memory bank methodology
- Updated README.md with clear project description and objectives focused on Quantexa scorecard simulation
- Updated project_context.md with core project information extracted from original tuning_sim project
- Established development approach: start with core Scorecard simulation, then incrementally add analysis capabilities
- Defined scope: copy scorecard simulation function, simplify all other functions to avoid repetitive/complex code
- **Successfully implemented simplified data_simulation.py module**
  - Reduced original ~300 lines to ~190 lines (37% reduction)
  - Kept all essential simulation functionality
  - Maintained weights override and prevalence control for future tuning experiments
  - Removed analysis methods (analyze_correlations, summary) and convenience functions
  - Consolidated redundant binary outcome methods into single flexible method
  - Basic functionality tested and confirmed working
- **Created simple analysis notebook with ROC curve and deciles analysis**
  - Built `notebooks/simple_analysis.ipynb` demonstrating core functionality
  - ROC curve analysis shows AUC of 0.846 (good discrimination)
  - Deciles analysis shows clear separation: 0% outcome rate in lowest decile to 46.6% in highest
  - Fixed duplicate edges issue in qcut using duplicates='drop' parameter
  - Notebook fully functional and tested
- **Implemented notebook output cleaning workflow**
  - Copied and tested `clear_notebook_outputs.py` script from original tuning_sim project
  - Updated `.clinerules` with critical notebook cleaning protocol
  - Added notebook management guidance to `project_context.md`
  - Script successfully clears outputs and execution counts from all notebooks
  - Ensures clean version control and prevents repository bloat from output data

## Active Work Items
- ✅ **Completed: Simple analysis notebook successfully created and tested** (`notebooks/simple_analysis.ipynb`)
  - Demonstrates data simulation with Scorecard class (5000 samples, 8 features, 10% binary prevalence)
  - Includes ROC curve analysis (AUC: 0.843) showing good discrimination
  - Shows deciles analysis of binary outcomes by total_score with clear separation
  - Results show excellent discrimination: outcome rates range from 0% (D1) to 33% (D9)
  - Mean scores significantly higher for positive outcomes (4.283) vs negative (3.500)
  - Score distribution plots show clear separation between positive/negative outcomes
  - All visualizations working correctly with proper formatting
- ✅ **Completed: Added optional beta parameter to binary outcome generator**
  - Enhanced `generate_binary_outcome()` method with configurable beta parameter (default 2.0)
  - Beta controls the slope coefficient in logistic regression: Log odds = α + β * total_score
  - Higher beta values create stronger correlation between total_score and binary outcome
  - Tested with beta values 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 showing expected behavior:
    - Correlation increases from 0.134 (β=0.5) to 0.407 (β=4.0)
    - AUC improves from 0.632 to 0.932 with higher beta values
    - Prevalence remains stable around target 0.1 for all beta values
  - Implementation maintains backward compatibility (default beta=2.0)
- ✅ **Completed: Optimized Scorecard class memory usage by removing binary_scores storage**
  - Modified Scorecard class to calculate binary scores on-the-fly instead of storing them
  - Removed `binary_scores` attribute from class to reduce memory footprint
  - Updated `_calculate_total_scores()` method to compute binary scores directly during calculation
  - Removed unused `_calculate_binary_scores()` method to clean up code
  - Updated class docstring to reflect the new behavior
  - All existing functionality preserved - total scores computed identically
  - Comprehensive testing confirmed full backward compatibility with existing analysis code
  - Memory savings especially beneficial for large datasets with many features
- Ready to add additional analysis capabilities as needed for specific tasks

## Next Steps/TODO List
- Implement core Scorecard class with configurable weights and binary outcome generation
- Create basic testing framework for scorecard functionality
- Build simple analysis capabilities incrementally
- Add visualization and evaluation tools as needed
- Focus on essential functionality only - avoid complexity from original project

## Known Issues/Challenges
- Need to balance learning from original project while avoiding its complexity and repetitive patterns
- Must resist urge to over-engineer and focus on simplest implementations that meet requirements

## Insights & Learnings
- Fresh restart allows adoption of cleaner coding patterns
- Starting with minimal scope helps avoid complexity creep
- Focus on core simulation first, then build analysis capabilities incrementally
- Original project provides good reference for requirements but not necessarily implementation approach

## Decision Log
- **Restart approach**: Copy project description and scorecard simulation, rebuild everything else with simpler implementations
- **Incremental development**: Start with core simulation, add capabilities only as needed
- **Code quality focus**: Prioritize readability and maintainability over comprehensive features
- **Minimal scope**: Avoid copying complex analysis frameworks from original project
