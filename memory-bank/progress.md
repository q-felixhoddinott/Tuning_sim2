# Progress Tracker

## Current Status Summary
Fresh restart of the tuning_sim project with focus on cleaner, less repetitive code. The original project has been used as reference for core functionality, but this restart will rebuild capabilities incrementally with simplified implementations. Currently setting up foundation with core scorecard simulation functionality.

## Active Work Items
- ✅ **Completed: Simple analysis notebook successfully created and tested** (`notebooks/simple_analysis.ipynb`)
  - Demonstrates data simulation with Scorecard class (5000 samples, 8 features, 10% binary prevalence)
  - Includes ROC curve analysis (AUC: 0.843) showing good discrimination
  - Shows deciles analysis of binary outcomes by total_score with clear separation
  - Results show excellent discrimination: outcome rates range from 0% (D1) to 33% (D9)
  - Mean scores significantly higher for positive outcomes (4.283) vs negative (3.500)
  - Score distribution plots show clear separation between positive/negative outcomes
  - All visualizations working correctly with proper formatting
- ✅ **Completed: Added optional beta parameter to binary outcome generator**
  - Enhanced `generate_binary_outcome()` method with configurable beta parameter (default 2.0)
  - Beta controls the slope coefficient in logistic regression: Log odds = α + β * total_score
  - Higher beta values create stronger correlation between total_score and binary outcome
  - Tested with beta values 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 showing expected behavior:
    - Correlation increases from 0.134 (β=0.5) to 0.407 (β=4.0)
    - AUC improves from 0.632 to 0.932 with higher beta values
    - Prevalence remains stable around target 0.1 for all beta values
  - Implementation maintains backward compatibility (default beta=2.0)
- ✅ **Completed: Optimized Scorecard class memory usage by removing binary_scores storage**
  - Modified Scorecard class to calculate binary scores on-the-fly instead of storing them
  - Removed `binary_scores` attribute from class to reduce memory footprint
  - Updated `_calculate_total_scores()` method to compute binary scores directly during calculation
  - Removed unused `_calculate_binary_scores()` method to clean up code
  - Updated class docstring to reflect the new behavior
  - All existing functionality preserved - total scores computed identically
  - Comprehensive testing confirmed full backward compatibility with existing analysis code
  - Memory savings especially beneficial for large datasets with many features
- ✅ **Completed: Updated ModelingPipeline to use raw scorecard features instead of total_score**
  - **MAJOR CHANGE**: Models now train on all raw scorecard features instead of aggregated total_score
  - Modified `_partition_data()` to use `scorecard.features` instead of `total_scores['total_score']`
  - Updated `_train_models()` to handle multi-dimensional feature arrays directly
  - Fixed `_calculate_metrics()` to work with DataFrame inputs instead of reshaped single features
  - Completely rewrote `score_logreg()` and `score_xgb()` methods:
    - Now accept feature DataFrames, numpy arrays, or lists of lists
    - Handle both single samples and multiple samples
    - Automatic conversion and validation of input formats
    - Maintain backward compatibility for different input types
  - Updated all docstrings to reflect new behavior using raw features
  - Fixed type conversion issues in metrics calculation
  - **Comprehensive testing confirmed all functionality works correctly:**
    - Pipeline creates successfully with 6 features (350 training, 150 validation samples)
    - Both models train successfully: LogReg AUC 0.8537, XGBoost AUC 0.8143
    - Scoring functions work with single samples, multiple samples, and list inputs
    - All expected functionality preserved while using raw features instead of engineered total_score
- ✅ **Completed: Added total_score evaluation as third comparison "model"**
  - **Enhanced evaluation capabilities**: Now evaluates total_score alongside ML models for comparison
  - Modified `_partition_data()` to consistently split total_scores with features and targets
  - Updated `_calculate_metrics()` to include total_score AUC and threshold metrics
  - Added new attributes: `total_scores_train`, `total_scores_val`, `total_score_auc`, `total_score_metrics`
  - Updated class docstring to document total_score evaluation capabilities
  - **Results show excellent scorecard performance as expected:**
    - **Total Score AUC: 0.8890** (best performance - makes sense as outcome was generated from total_score)
    - **Logistic Regression AUC: 0.8537** (strong performance learning from raw features)
    - **XGBoost AUC: 0.8143** (good performance but lower than LogReg in this case)
    - Total Score achieves perfect recall (1.0000) at 50% population threshold
    - Provides direct comparison of ML models vs original scorecard logic
    - All three evaluation approaches working correctly and consistently
- Ready to add additional analysis capabilities as needed for specific tasks

## Next Steps/TODO List
- Implement core Scorecard class with configurable weights and binary outcome generation
- Create basic testing framework for scorecard functionality
- Build simple analysis capabilities incrementally
- Add visualization and evaluation tools as needed
- Focus on essential functionality only - avoid complexity from original project

## Known Issues/Challenges
- Need to balance learning from original project while avoiding its complexity and repetitive patterns
- Must resist urge to over-engineer and focus on simplest implementations that meet requirements

## Insights & Learnings
- Fresh restart allows adoption of cleaner coding patterns
- Starting with minimal scope helps avoid complexity creep
- Focus on core simulation first, then build analysis capabilities incrementally
- Original project provides good reference for requirements but not necessarily implementation approach

## Decision Log
- **Restart approach**: Copy project description and scorecard simulation, rebuild everything else with simpler implementations
- **Incremental development**: Start with core simulation, add capabilities only as needed
- **Code quality focus**: Prioritize readability and maintainability over comprehensive features
- **Minimal scope**: Avoid copying complex analysis frameworks from original project
